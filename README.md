NITFLIX, Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Power BI)
## Project Objective NITFLIX wants to create an annual performance report. This dashboard is designed to help the management understand customer behavior and identify key sales trends, enabling data-driven decisions to accelerate growth in 1942 & 2015.
I developed an end-to-end Power BI project to transform raw data into actionable insights. The process involved building a robust data model, implementing complex DAX measures for advanced calculations, and designing interactive dashboards. I handled the entire pipeline, from data extraction and cleaning via Power Query to creating dynamic visualizations that simplify decision-making.
