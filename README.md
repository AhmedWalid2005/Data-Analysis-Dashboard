# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed an end-to-end Power BI project to transform raw data into actionable insights. The process involved building a robust data model, implementing complex DAX measures for advanced calculations, and designing interactive dashboards. I handled the entire pipeline, from data extraction and cleaning via Power Query to creating dynamic visualizations that simplify decision-making.
